# ⛓️ Dechainer: Reclaim Your Freedom

**Break the digital chains. Reclaim your focus. Reclaim your life.**

Dechainer is not just another porn blocker—it is an **iron-clad commitment** to a life free from digital addiction. Designed for those who are serious about quitting, Dechainer leverages deep Android system privileges to create barriers that are nearly impossible to bypass, ensuring you stay on the path to recovery even in moments of weakness.

## 🛡️ Iron-Clad Protection

Most blockers are easily disabled in a moment of urge. Dechainer is different. By utilizing **Device Owner** privileges, it locks the system down from the inside out.

### 🚀 Key Features

*   **🌐 Nuclear DNS Blocking:** Force the system to use family-safe Private DNS providers (like Cloudflare Family or AdGuard DNS). Content is filtered at the network level before it even reaches your screen.
*   **🚫 VPN Lockdown:** Prevents the installation or configuration of VPNs. No more "backdoors" to bypass your filters.
*   **📱 App Management:**
    *   **Total Block:** Hide specific apps completely from your launcher.
    *   **Uninstall Protection:** Prevent apps from being removed, ensuring your defensive tools stay put.
*   **🔒 System Integrity:** Blocks factory resets, safe boot, and ADB debugging to ensure the only way out is through your recovery key.

## ⚙️ How it Works (The Shizuku Bridge)

To gain the "Superpowers" required to lock down the system, Dechainer uses **Shizuku**. 
1.  Install [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/).
2.  Grant Dechainer permission through Shizuku.
3.  Follow the steps required in Settings tab.
4.  Dechainer will then promote itself to **Device Owner**—the highest level of authority on an Android device.

## ⚠️ THE NUCLEAR WARNING: RISK OF SELF-LOCKOUT

**PLEASE READ CAREFULLY.**

Dechainer is designed to be **unforgiving**. If you enable all restrictions and lose your **16-character Recovery Key**, you may be permanently locked out of certain system settings or unable to uninstall the app without a total device wipe (if even allowed).

*   **This is a feature, not a bug.** It is meant to stop "your future self" from relapsing.
*   **Store your Recovery Key physically.** Write it on a piece of paper and hide it. Do not rely on digital notes that you might block yourself from accessing.

By removing the *possibility* of a relapse, you free up mental energy to focus on what truly matters: your goals, your family, and your future.

**Stop fighting the urges with just willpower. Use Dechainer to change the rules of the game.**
